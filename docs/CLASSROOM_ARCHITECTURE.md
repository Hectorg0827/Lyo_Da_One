# LYO — Living AI Classroom Architecture Audit

Status: living document. Written before Phase A, updated as each phase lands.

This is an audit of what **actually exists today** across the four LYO
codebases, mapped onto the canonical learning loop. It exists so that we
converge on the strongest system already in the repos instead of adding an
n+1'th mastery engine.

Repos covered:

| Repo | Contents | Write access from this workstream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Hectorg0827/Lyo_Da_One` | Web (Next.js), iOS (SwiftUI), Android (Compose), parity scripts | yes |
| `Hectorg0827/LyoBackendJune` | FastAPI backend (`lyo_app/`) | read-only |

Because the backend is read-only from here, backend rows below are recorded
as **contract decisions** the clients code against, not as edits already made.

---

## 1. The canonical loop

```
USER INTENT
   -> LYO router / entry flow
   -> LIVING AI CLASSROOM
   -> CLASSROOM DIRECTOR          (chooses the pedagogical move)
   -> SCENE / TEACHING MOVE       (LLM fills content inside the move)
   -> LIVE LEARNING SURFACE       (board + voice + captions)
   -> LEARNER ACTION
   -> LEARNING EVENT
   -> EVIDENCE                    (exposure..retention, graded server-side)
   -> CANONICAL LEARNER MODEL
   -> MASTERY + RETENTION + MISCONCEPTIONS
   -> NEXT BEST PEDAGOGICAL ACTION
   -> CLASSROOM DIRECTOR
```

Every subsystem below is classified against this loop as one of:

- **CANONICAL** — the one true implementation; everything else adapts to it.
- **ADAPTER** — translates a legacy shape into the canonical one.
- **MIGRATION_ONLY** — retained solely so existing rows/users keep working.
- **LEGACY_ACTIVE** — still on a live code path; needs an adapter before removal.
- **SAFE_TO_REMOVE** — no imports, no routes, no tests, no platform depends on it.

---

## 2. Backend inventory (`lyo_app/`)

The backend contains **four** overlapping learning-state systems. This is the
single largest source of incoherence in the product.

| Module | Models | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lyo_app/ai_classroom/models.py` | `GraphCourse`, `LearningNode`, `LearningEdge`, `Concept`, `Misconception`, `MasteryState`, `ReviewSchedule`, `InteractionAttempt`, `CourseProgress` | **CANONICAL** | Richest model. Concept-graph based, has misconceptions, SM-2 review schedule, per-attempt history. This is the intended learner brain. |
| `lyo_app/personalization/models.py` | `LearnerState`, `LearnerMastery`, `AffectSample`, `SpacedRepetitionSchedule`, `MemoryInsight` | **LEGACY_ACTIVE** | Duplicates mastery and spaced repetition. `AffectSample` / `MemoryInsight` have no equivalent in `ai_classroom` and are worth folding in rather than dropping. |
| `lyo_app/events/models.py` | `LearningEvent` (52 lines) | **CANONICAL (thin)** | Correct concept, under-built. Should become the single write path into mastery. |
| `lyo_app/classroom/models.py` | `ClassroomSession`, `ClassroomInteraction` | **CANONICAL (session layer)** | Session/transport concern, not a competing learner model. Keep. |

### 2.1 What `MasteryState` is missing

`ai_classroom.MasteryState` today carries `mastery_score`, `confidence`,
`attempts`, `correct_count`, `incorrect_count`, `error_pattern`,
`misconception_tags`, `last_seen`, `last_correct`, `trend`.

It does **not** carry the evidence ladder. To satisfy the mastery standard it
needs:

- `evidence_level` — the highest rung reached (see §3)
- `retention_strength` — distinct from `confidence`; decays with time
- `last_demonstrated_at` — distinct from `last_seen` (exposure is not evidence)
- `next_review_at` — denormalised from `ReviewSchedule` for cheap Home reads

Until the backend adds these, clients derive `evidence_level` from the
event stream and treat it as advisory, never authoritative.

### 2.2 Convergence plan (backend, when writable)

1. `events.LearningEvent` becomes the **only** write path to mastery. Nothing
   else may mutate `MasteryState` directly.
2. `personalization.LearnerMastery` gets a read-through **ADAPTER** onto
   `ai_classroom.MasteryState`, then becomes MIGRATION_ONLY.
3. `personalization.SpacedRepetitionSchedule` folds into
   `ai_classroom.ReviewSchedule` (both are SM-2; the latter is more complete).
4. `AffectSample` and `MemoryInsight` move under the canonical learner model
   as signals the Director reads.

### 2.3 Correction: which table actually carries live data

An earlier draft of this document recommended converging **onto**
`ai_classroom.MasteryState` because its schema is richer. Reading the backend
with write access showed that recommendation was backwards on the facts.

`ai_classroom.MasteryState` is **read** by the classroom's scene engine before
every teaching decision, and written by nothing on the live path:
`graph_service` fires only from the playback routes, and `interaction_service`
has no callers at all. Meanwhile `personalization.LearnerMastery` is written
by every chat check and carries all the accumulated learner data there is.

So the Classroom has been adapting its teaching from a table Chat never fills.
A learner who demonstrated a concept in Chat arrived at the Classroom as a
stranger. Migrating rows between the two would have picked a winner; instead
both become views of one event stream, which is what lets them agree.

### 2.4 Backend convergence — what landed

| Change | Where (`LyoBackendJune`) |
| --- | --- |
| Server twin of the client's evidence vocabulary | `lyo_app/events/evidence.py` |
| Evidence columns on `LearningEvent` (concept, rung, confidence, hints, misconception, surface) | `lyo_app/events/models.py`, `alembic/versions/evidence_001_*` |
| Evidence projected into the table the Classroom reads | `lyo_app/events/mastery_projection.py` |
| Chat's check emits evidence | `lyo_app/api/v1/stream_lyo2.py` |
| Classroom's graded submissions emit evidence | `lyo_app/ai_classroom/scene_lifecycle_engine.py` |
| Projection exercised against a real database | `tests/test_mastery_projection_db.py` |

Three decisions worth keeping visible:

- **Concept identity.** Chat names concepts by slug; `MasteryState.concept_id`
  is foreign-keyed to `concepts.id`, which holds UUIDs. Slugs therefore go to
  `objective_id`, which has no foreign key, under a partial unique index on
  `(user_id, objective_id)`. Without that index SQL treats the null
  `concept_id` values as distinct and two concurrent checks create two rows.
- **No double counting.** Both surfaces already run a DKT update directly for
  the answer they are logging, so the event deliberately omits
  `skill_ids_json` — the field that asks the processor to run a second one.
- **Hidden rubrics stay hidden.** The transfer scorer's list of missed
  keywords is never written into the learner model. It is grading internals;
  stored there it would sit one render away from the screen.

Still open: `personalization.LearnerMastery` has not yet become an adapter
(step 2 above), and the SM-2 schedules have not been folded (step 3).

---

## 3. The evidence ladder

Mastery is never granted for watching, pressing Continue, spending time, or
receiving an explanation. It is granted for demonstrated evidence:

```
NOT_SEEN -> EXPOSED -> RECOGNIZED -> EXPLAINED -> APPLIED -> TRANSFERRED -> RETAINED -> MASTERED
```

| Rung | Earned by | Strength |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | Instruction was delivered | none on its own |
| `recognition` | Correct selection in context | weak |
| `explanation` | Learner explains it acceptably | moderate |
| `application` | Correct use on a familiar problem | strong |
| `transfer` | Correct use in a novel context | strongest single form |
| `retention` | Correct retrieval after a real interval | confirms durability |

`MASTERED` requires high-confidence evidence across **application + transfer +
retention**, not a high score on any one of them.

Hints reduce the confidence attached to a rung; they never demote the rung and
asking for help is never scored as failure. A skipped question is neutral: it
produces no evidence in either direction.

---

## 4. Cross-platform client inventory

### 4.1 Shared contract (already exists — keep and extend)

`web/src/lib/classroom-contract.mjs` is the **CANONICAL** wire contract and is
already mirrored by the iOS and Android clients and enforced by
`scripts/verify-classroom-parity.mjs`.

It pins: classroom modes (`solo` / `classroom` / `challenge` / `review`), the
hint ladder (`nudge` / `principle` / `worked_step` / `full_example` /
`prerequisite`), `client_contract_version: '2'`, course/lesson/session
identity, locale, and reduced-motion.

This is the right shape. Phase B extends it with the learner-model contract
rather than introducing a second one.

### 4.2 Web

| Path | Role | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web/src/lib/classroom-contract.mjs` | Wire contract | **CANONICAL** |
| `web/src/stores/classroom-store.ts` | Classroom session state, WS transport, board state | **CANONICAL** |
| `web/src/app/(main)/classroom/page.tsx` | Live classroom surface | **CANONICAL** |
| `web/src/components/classroom/*` | Board elements, explorable, caption sync, flow controls | **CANONICAL** |
| `web/src/stores/chat-store.ts` | Chat + `dueReviews` + server-graded answer checks | **LEGACY_ACTIVE** — owns spaced repetition that belongs to the learner model |
| `web/src/lib/learning-progress.ts` | Lesson completion / course progress | **ADAPTER** onto backend `CourseProgress` |
| `web/src/components/profile/LearningStats.tsx` | Profile stats | **SAFE_TO_REMOVE (fabricated parts)** — see §5 |

### 4.3 iOS (`Sources/`)

| Path | Role | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Services/LivingClassroomService.swift` | WS transport, barge-in, locale | **CANONICAL** |
| `Views/Main/Classroom/LivingClassroomView.swift` | Live classroom surface | **CANONICAL** |
| `Views/Classroom/ActiveLessonView.swift` | Lesson rendering, offline-safe skip | **CANONICAL** |
| `Models/SDUIModels.swift` | Server-driven component catalog | **CANONICAL** |
| ~~`Services/LivingClassroomEngine.swift`~~ | On-device teaching engine | **REMOVED** in Phase C — unreachable, and a client-side teaching engine makes iOS a pedagogically different product (see §10) |
| `ViewModels/ClassroomViewModel.swift`, `Models/Classroom.swift` | Older classroom path | **LEGACY_ACTIVE** — parity gate pins its authored-quick-check contract |
| ~~`ViewModels/AgenticClassroomViewModel.swift`, `Views/Main/Classroom/AgenticClassroomView.swift`~~ | Third classroom path | **REMOVED** in Phase C — the two referenced only each other; nothing routed to either (see §10) |
| ~~`Services/LyoClassroomService.swift`~~ | Fourth classroom service | **REMOVED** in Phase C — unreachable duplicate WebSocket transport (see §10) |

iOS carried **four** classroom entry points; Phase C removed the three that
nothing routed to. `LivingClassroomView` / `LivingClassroomService` is now the
only one, and the parity gate fails if any of the other three reappears.

### 4.4 Android (`android/app/src/main/java/com/lyo/app/`)

| Path | Role | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ui/screens/classroom/ClassroomScreen.kt` | Live classroom surface + WS | **CANONICAL** |
| `ui/screens/classroom/ClassroomVoicePlayer.kt` | Voice + barge-in | **CANONICAL** |
| `ui/classroom/catalog/*` | Board element catalog (Latex, Mermaid, Code, Chart, Quiz, TransferInput, ...) | **CANONICAL** |

Android is the cleanest of the three clients: one classroom, one catalog.

---

## 5. Fabricated learner data (Phase A target)

Production UI must never present invented activity as the learner's own.
Found in the web client:

| Location | Problem |
| --- | --- |
| `web/src/app/(main)/page.tsx` | `dailyChallenges` is a hard-coded array with invented `progress` values (`1/2` lessons, `7/10` minutes) rendered as this user's real challenge progress |
| `web/src/components/profile/LearningStats.tsx` | `generateCalendarData()` builds a 28-day activity heatmap from `Math.random()` and renders it as the learner's study history |
| `web/src/components/profile/LearningStats.tsx` | `achievements` is a hard-coded list with three arbitrarily marked `unlocked: true` |
| `web/src/app/(main)/page.tsx` | Zero-dashboard: a brand-new user is shown Level 1 / 0 XP / 0 hours / 0 courses rather than a reason to start |

Fix posture: real API data where an endpoint exists
(`api.gamification.achievements()`, `api.chat.dueReviews()`), an intentional
empty state where it does not, and no component at all where neither is
meaningful.

---

## 6. Spaced repetition is real but trapped

`api.chat.dueReviews()` -> `/api/v1/lyo2/chat/reviews/due` returns
`{ skill_id, days_overdue, mastery_level, last_misconception }` and is already
wired through `chat-store.ts` into `DueReviewsNudge.tsx`.

It correctly generates a **fresh** retrieval question rather than replaying the
old one.

The problem is scope: it is visible only inside Chat. Due reviews are a
property of the learner, not of a surface. They belong on Home, in Review mode,
and in exam readiness. Surfacing them on Home is Phase A; routing them into
Classroom Review mode is Phase C.

---

## 7. Phase plan against this audit

| Phase | Scope | Depends on backend writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A — Product trust** | Remove fabricated data; new front door; surface due reviews on Home; unify branding; guest can reach Classroom | no |
| **B — Canonical learner intelligence** | Client-side canonical learner-model contract + adapters; Chat/Classroom/Test Prep read one state | partially |
| **C — Classroom core** | Collapse iOS's four classroom paths; Director owns move selection; Review mode | no |
| **D — Signature board** | Representation selection per subject; explorables emit evidence | no |
| **E — Test prep integration** | Diagnostic -> canonical mastery -> readiness -> classroom sessions | yes |
| **F — Product graph** | Home recommendations, Learning Around Me, Clips loop | no |

### 7.1 Phases D–F — what landed, and what the audit got wrong again

| Change | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Explorables: `number_line` and `timeline` on a lesson's representation section | `lyo_app/ai/lesson_composer.py`, `web/src/lib/explorable.mjs`, `ExplorableBlock.tsx` |
| Test Prep teaches and grades, so it produces evidence at all | `lyo_app/api/v1/stream_lyo2.py` |
| Home recommendations from the learner's own record, with reasons | `lyo_app/personalization/recommendations.py`, `NextForYou.tsx` |
| The classroom's failure path teaches instead of dead-ending | `lyo_app/ai_classroom/scene_lifecycle_engine.py` |
| One SM-2 and one schedule for both surfaces | `lyo_app/personalization/spaced_repetition.py` |
| One key per skill, with a merging migration | `alembic/versions/skillkey_001_*` |

**Three things this document said that were wrong**, all the same mistake —
recommending convergence onto the table with the better schema rather than the
one with the data:

1. `personalization` onto `ai_classroom.MasteryState` (corrected in §2.3).
2. `SpacedRepetitionSchedule` folds into `ReviewSchedule`, "the latter is more
   complete". Backwards for the same reason: `ReviewSchedule`'s only writers
   have no callers, so the classroom's `/review/today` served an empty queue to
   every learner while they had items genuinely due in the other table.
3. `LearnerMastery` should become a read-through adapter. With both tables now
   fed from one event stream they already agree, and turning the DKT estimate
   into a facade over a simpler score would be a downgrade, not a convergence.
   The step is dropped rather than deferred.

**What Test Prep's gap actually was.** Not "it does not log evidence" — it
never *graded* anything. Only `Intent.EXPLAIN` reached the lesson composer, so
a learner could work through a whole test-prep session without being asked a
question the server could mark. Adding a logging call would have done nothing.

### 7.3 Phase E — the study plan had its own opinion of the learner

Phase E was the one row of the table above that was never built. The
"I Have a Test" system is real and live — `/api/v1/me/study_plans`, registered
in `lyo_app/api/v1/__init__.py`, called by iOS — but it was an island.

| Change | Where |
| --- | --- |
| A session's score is derived from evidence, never declared by the client | `lyo_app/study_plans/session_outcome.py` |
| A plan's topics join to the learner's canonical record | `lyo_app/study_plans/topic_standing.py` |
| Readiness for one test, weighted by topic | `GET /me/study_plans/plans/{id}/readiness` |
| A session carries the concept id the Classroom teaches from | `StudySessionRead.concept_id` |

**A third client-declared-truth violation.** `POST
/me/study_plans/sessions/{id}/complete` took `performance_score` as a
*required query parameter* — the device saying how well its owner had done —
stored it as the learner's performance, and `get_plan_stats` averaged those
numbers into `mastery_by_topic`. Any learner with a token could post
themselves to full marks on every topic of their exam. This is the same rule
broken in §7.2 twice over, on a route nobody had looked at.

The score is now read back out of the evidence the server itself recorded
while the session was open. Where nothing was graded the session completes
with **no score at all**, because a session spent reading is a real session
and measuring it would be an invention.

**Deciding what counts as a demonstration is `measurable_outcome`, not the
rung.** A wrong answer and a lesson delivered both sit on `exposure` at zero
confidence, so reading the rung alone would score a click on an explorable as
a failed attempt. `project_event_to_mastery_state` already had to answer this
question; `session_outcome` deliberately uses the same test rather than a
second one, since two places deciding "was this a demonstration" by different
rules is exactly how the surfaces drifted apart to begin with.

**Never assessed is not assessed at zero — except where it is.** A topic the
learner has never been measured on reports `mastery: null`, and
`mastery_by_topic` omits it, so a heatmap cannot render "nothing yet" and
"measured, got nothing" as the same cell. But that same topic contributes
*zero* to readiness, because for "am I ready for Friday" a topic you have
shown nothing on is a topic you are not ready for. The two judgements look
contradictory and are not: one is about a concept, the other about an exam.

**What mutation testing changed.** `weakest_topics` originally ranked every
never-assessed topic above every measured one. Breaking that rule and watching
no test fail exposed that the rule itself was wrong: it would send a learner
to a topic worth one percent of the paper they had not started, ahead of one
worth forty they had attempted and got entirely wrong. Both have nothing
demonstrated, so weight breaks the tie.

**Not done, deliberately.** The backend now carries `concept_id` on every
session read, so a scheduled session *can* open the Classroom on its topic.
No client surface uses it yet: the web app has no test-prep screen at all, and
building an iOS one is product work rather than wiring. Stated here rather
than implied by the phase being ticked.

### 7.2 Two trust failures found while building the above

Both were live, both on registered routes, and neither was on any list:

- **Answer keys travelled with the question.** `correct_index`, the
  explanation, and each option's `reveals` (the misconception tag naming what
  choosing it would say about the learner) were serialised into the check
  block and streamed to the client. The client declined to use them, and said
  so in a comment — but a learner with the network tab open could read the
  answer before choosing. Now stripped at all three exits: the streamed
  lesson, the streamed planner blocks, and the conversation reload.
- **A client could post itself to mastery.** `POST /api/v1/evolution/events`
  accepted `evidence_type`, `evidence_confidence`, `measurable_outcome` and
  `skill_ids_json` straight from the device. A client may now say what it did,
  never what that proved: its events are recorded as exposure with no graded
  outcome. This is also what makes explorable engagement safe to record at
  all.

### 7.4 iOS study plans persisted nothing, and said they did

Found while scoping the one open Phase E item — a client surface that opens the
Classroom from a scheduled session. There was no surface to extend: iOS's whole
study-plan integration was inert, and had been.

`LyoOverlayView` ran this when a learner accepted a study-plan card:

> Stage B2 — persist the plan to backend so it survives app restart.
> Fire-and-forget; if auth fails we fall through to the chat-only path.

It POSTed to `/api/v1/me/study_plans`. From the live route table — the actual
registered routes, not a reading of the source — that path carries **GET only**:

```
['GET']  /me/study_plans
['POST'] /me/study_plans/intake/turn
['POST'] /me/study_plans/plans/generate
```

So every call was a 405, and `try?` discarded it. No learner's plan was ever
saved, and nothing ever said so.

The rest was worse than unused. `StudyPlanService.fetch/get/update/delete` had
**no callers anywhere**, and `StudyPlanRecord` could not have decoded a real
response if they had: it declares `id: Int` where the server sends a UUID
string, and requires `subject`, `topics` and `daily_breakdown`, none of which
exist on `StudyPlanRead`. Its doc comment says it mirrors
`StudyPlanRecordRead` — a schema that is not in the codebase.

There was therefore no field-renaming fix available. The shape iOS wanted
corresponds to nothing the server has: the server builds a plan from a
`TestProfile` through a conversational intake, producing a `StudyPlan` and its
`StudySession` rows.

**What was removed:** `StudyPlanService.swift`, `StudyPlanRecord.swift`, the
`StudyPlansAPI` endpoint enum, the `create` call site, and the eight
`project.pbxproj` entries for the two files, deleted by UUID so a local
checkout opens without regenerating. Behaviour-preserving: the call was
fire-and-forget, so nothing a learner sees changes. `verify-classroom-parity`
fails if either file returns or if a client POSTs to that path again.

**What this left open, and how it closed.** iOS had no study-plan persistence
at all — the honest state rather than a hidden one, and a prerequisite for the
Classroom entry point rather than a substitute for it. Wiring iOS to
`intake/turn` then `plans/generate` is done in §7.6; the removed files stay
forbidden by the gate so the broken pair cannot come back beside the working
one.

**Why not just add a POST route.** It would be the fourth time this codebase
solved a mismatch by building a second path alongside the one that works —
see the three corrections in §7.1. Plan creation already exists; a parallel
endpoint would split it.

---

### 7.5 Test Prep gets a face, and a way to exist at all

§7.3 recorded that iOS's study-plan integration was inert. The larger fact
behind it: **no learner on any platform could create a study plan.** The only
writers of `TestProfile`, `StudyPlan` and `StudySession` are `intake_turn` and
`plans/generate`, and nothing called either — so `readiness`, `sessions/today`
and `plans/{id}/stats` were live endpoints with no possible data, and the
Phase E work of §7.3 reported on tables that were empty for everyone.

`web/src/app/(main)/test-prep/page.tsx` is both halves. A learner with no plan
is asked about their test by the server's own intake coach, one question at a
time, and the answers become a plan with scheduled sessions. A learner with a
plan sees where they stand and steps from a session into the Classroom.

| Piece | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Rules about what a learner is told | `web/src/lib/test-prep.mjs` (27 tests) |
| The page | `web/src/app/(main)/test-prep/page.tsx` |
| Reachable from | the sidebar, `/test-prep` |

**The rule this page exists to get right.** A plan with nothing assessed yet
carries a readiness of `0`. Rendering that as "0% ready" tells a learner they
failed something nobody ever asked them — the same fabrication as the
`Math.random()` activity heatmap Phase A removed, arrived at by arithmetic
instead. So `readinessHeadline` returns a *kind* rather than a number:
`unmeasured` ("you haven't been tested on any of this yet"), `unknown` (no
topics, so nothing to be ready for), or `measured`. The page branches on the
kind, and the gate rejects both rendering the raw figure and `percent ?? 0`,
which would collapse every unmeasured case straight back to zero.

`topicStanding` draws the same line per topic: `mastery: null` reads "Not
started", never "0%".

**Found by the tests, not by review.** `Number(null)` is `0` in JavaScript, so
the first version of `readinessHeadline` reported a null readiness as a
measured 0%. A test written for the honest behaviour caught it before the page
existed.

**A session opens the Classroom through the shared entry contract**, so a
practice session does not open in review mode here while it opens correctly
everywhere else — the distinction §7.1 had to fix once already. An
unrecognised `session_type` is taught rather than guessed into a mode, so a
future planner inventing a type cannot silently start writing the wrong kind
of evidence.

**Guests.** The page is reachable from the nav, and a study plan needs an
account. A signed-out visitor is offered sign-in *and* the guest-safe route
that already worked — Chat on the test-prep turn — rather than being bounced
to `/auth/login` by a supplementary call, which is the §7.2 failure.

**Closing a session out.** A learner can now mark a session done, and this is
where the Phase E trust fix becomes visible. The client sends **no score** —
the route derives the outcome from the evidence the server itself recorded and
replies with what it found. The page reports that reply, including the common
case: *"Nothing in this session was graded, so there is no score."*

`completionSummary` keeps the three answers apart. `scored` is a figure with
graded work behind it; `unscored` is a session where the learner met the
concept but nothing asked them to demonstrate it — **not a zero**; `empty` is
nothing recorded at all. A silent 0% on "done" would reintroduce by omission
exactly the fabrication that removing client-sent scores removed.

Two guards are worth naming because both were found by mutating the code and
watching nothing fail. `Number(null)` is `0`, so a null score is checked for
before it is coerced. And a score is only reported when `graded > 0`: the
server cannot currently send a figure with nothing graded behind it, but the
figure is only meaningful as a summary of graded work, so the client refuses
to render one that has none.

The gate rejects `performance_score` appearing in any client request, as a
query parameter or in a body.

**Still open.** The plan's `stats` endpoint has no UI — `readiness` covers the
same ground more honestly, so it may simply not need one.

---

### 7.6 iOS Test Prep, and a concept key that pointed nowhere

iOS now runs the same flow: `Sources/Views/Main/TestPrep/TestPrepView.swift`,
reached from the Focus tab, with the decisions in `TestPrepPresentation` and
`TestPrepState` where tests can drive them. Nobody in this workstream can tap
through an iOS build, so that separation is not a nicety here — it is the only
verification this logic gets, and §3k of `verify-product-trust.mjs` holds the
new surface to the same rules as the web one.

Two things this turned up that reading the route signatures would not have.

**The wire dates do not parse.** `scheduled_at` is serialised from a naive
`datetime` and arrives as `2026-09-11T22:00:00` — no timezone — and `test_date`
is a calendar date. `JSONDecoder.lyoDecoder` uses `ISO8601DateFormatter`, which
rejects both. Typed as `Date`, either would have failed the decode of an
otherwise perfectly good response: a correct answer, discarded, shown to the
learner as an error. Both are decoded as strings and parsed leniently.

**A demonstration was recorded against a sentence, not a concept.** The
Classroom took the concept a graded answer proved from `learning_objective` —
prose written for the Director, and exactly what `entry-contract.mjs` puts in
the `objective` query parameter. So a session opened from Home or Test Prep on
web filed its evidence under `practise_and_apply_quadratic_equations`, while
readiness, Chat and spaced repetition all name that idea
`quadratic_equations`.

Nothing looked broken. Evidence was written, the projection ran, a row
appeared — a row nothing would ever read. A learner could work through every
session their plan scheduled and still be told they had not started. iOS sent
no objective and so landed on the topic by luck; that luck is what this
section was originally going to build on.

The concept now comes from identity only — the lesson being taught, else the
topic — for both graded paths. Section 8 of `scripts/e2e_learner_loop.py`
teaches a topic the learner's own plan scheduled and asserts the plan sees it;
with the old derivation restored it reports the production symptom exactly
(`'Long division', mastery: None, attempts: 0` for a topic just answered
correctly).

**Still open on iOS.** The Classroom is opened with a topic but no `objective`
query parameter, where web sends one. After the fix above that no longer
affects which concept the evidence lands on — it is teaching guidance only —
but it does mean the Director gets less to work with on iOS than on web. Worth
closing for parity of teaching quality, not for correctness of the record.

**A name collision worth recording.** The first draft of the service was
written as `TestPrepService.swift`, which already existed — calendar events and
local notifications for an exam, with four live callers — and the new file
overwrote it. Caught by `git status` reporting a modification where an
addition was expected, and restored from `HEAD` before anything was committed.
It is now `TestPrepPlanService`; `StudyPlanService` was unavailable for the
opposite reason, being the name the gate keeps out. A whole-tree scan for
duplicate type declarations is what should have come first, and did after.

**Three findings from review, two of which were on web as well.**

*A failed plan lookup could still end in a second plan.* `load_failed`
deliberately refuses to send a learner who has a plan to intake — that
transition is commented at length for exactly this reason. But on a first load
we cannot tell, and the composer was left live beside a warning, so a learner
could walk into `plans/generate` by hand. On web it was worse: the opening turn
is sent automatically, so a failed lookup began building a duplicate with no
input at all. Both now block intake behind a retry until a successful lookup
says there is no plan, and the guard sits in the request path as well as on the
controls.

*A failed readiness call was silent.* The figure was kept and went on being
rendered as current. That is worst in the moment right after finishing a
session: the evidence has just changed, and the number on screen is the one
from before the work. Both platforms now say so on the readiness card — its own
sentence, not the page-level warning, since readiness can fail while everything
else loads.

*The planned length was dropped on the way into the Classroom.* The row says
"45 min"; `LivingClassroomService` sent a hard-coded `duration_minutes=10` and
the view counted against a five-minute target. The length now travels, through
a defaulted parameter so the four existing classroom entry points are untouched
and behave exactly as before.

**Not verified by anyone.** Every claim above about iOS is a claim about code
that compiles and passes its tests in CI. No one has run this screen on a
device or a simulator.

## 8. Phase A — what landed

| Change | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Hard-coded `dailyChallenges` removed from Home | `web/src/app/(main)/page.tsx` |
| `Math.random()` activity calendar and mock achievements removed | `web/src/components/profile/LearningStats.tsx` |
| Empty "Top Topics" chart frame no longer drawn | `web/src/components/profile/LearningStats.tsx` |
| Zero dashboard gated behind real activity | `web/src/app/(main)/page.tsx` (`showLearnerDashboard`) |
| Front door: "What do you want to learn?", Enter Classroom, I have a test | `web/src/components/home/FrontDoor.tsx` |
| Due reviews surfaced on Home, routed into Classroom review mode | `web/src/components/home/NextForYou.tsx` |
| Shared entry contract for opening the Classroom from any surface | `web/src/lib/entry-contract.mjs` |
| Chat accepts a seeded opening turn (`?prompt=`) | `web/src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx` |
| Brand converged on LYO across web, iOS and Android | layout metadata, PWA manifest, nav, chat, `Info.plist` |
| Product-trust CI gate | `scripts/verify-product-trust.mjs` |

### Why "I have a test" opens Chat

Test Prep is a real backend intent (`TEST_PREP` in `lyo_app/ai/router.py`),
resolved from what the learner says. The entry therefore says it and lets the
router ask for subject, date and materials. Standing a client-side test-prep
wizard in front of that would be a mock of a flow that already exists.

The full Test Prep product surface — diagnostic, exam readiness, study plan —
is Phase E and needs backend writes this workstream does not have.

### Known follow-ups

- `project.yml` still names the Xcode project `Lyo`. That is the build
  identifier, not the consumer-visible app name (`CFBundleDisplayName` is now
  `LYO`); renaming it moves the `.xcodeproj` and is not worth bundling into a
  product-trust change.
- `Sources/Services/A2A/AgentCardService.swift` reports the organization as
  "Lyo AI". Machine-facing agent-card metadata, left alone deliberately.
- Home still leads with XP and streak for an established learner. Section 22
  wants concepts learned / mastered / retained in that position; that depends
  on the canonical learner model and is Phase B.

---

## 9. Phase B — canonical learner intelligence (client side)

`web/src/lib/learner-model.mjs` is the client's single vocabulary for
evidence, mastery and retention. It is **not** a fifth mastery system: it owns
no state and decides no facts. The server remains authoritative on correctness
and on `mastery_score`; this module gives the four client surfaces one set of
words and one scale to say it in.

### 9.1 The scale bug this closed

Mastery reached the clients under three field names on two scales:

| Field | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `AnswerCheckResult.mastery` | chat check |
| `SessionSummarySkill.mastery` | session recap |
| `DueReviewItem.mastery_level` | spaced repetition |
| `Flashcard.mastery` | lesson block |

The backend stores 0..1 (`m.mastery_level:.0%`, `< 0.4`, `>= 0.7` in
`lyo_app/predictive` and `lyo_app/services`). `LessonView` rendered
`width: ${card.mastery}%`, so a card at 0.7 mastery drew a 0.7%-wide bar. The
codebase already knew about the ambiguity — `normalizeProgressPercent` in
`learning-progress.ts` handled exactly it — but only in one place. That rule
now lives in `normalizeMastery` / `masteryPercent`, and course progress is the
course-progress name for it.

`normalizeMastery` returns **null**, not 0, for a missing reading. "Never
assessed" and "assessed at zero" are different claims about a learner and the
UI must be able to tell them apart.

### 9.2 Adapting the wire vocabulary

`InputField.evidence_type` in `lyo_app/ai_classroom/sdui_models.py` is
`Literal["explanation", "application", "transfer", "retrieval"]` — narrower
than the product ladder in section 3, and it says "retrieval" where the ladder
says "retention". `normalizeEvidenceKind` adapts wire to ladder rather than
either side being renamed to match the other.

An unrecognised evidence type returns null and advances no rung. A new
server-side type must not be silently scored as `exposure`, and certainly not
as `transfer`.

### 9.3 Rules the module enforces

- `MASTERED` requires application **and** transfer **and** retention, each at
  or above `MASTERY_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`. Any two is not enough.
- A skipped question (`bailed_out`) yields no evidence at all — not evidence of
  failure.
- Hints damp the confidence attached to a demonstration; they never demote the
  rung, and asking for help is never scored as failure.
- A classroom submission the server did not accept is `exposure`. Submitting is
  not demonstrating.
- An incorrect answer still carries its misconception forward, and a
  misconception survives a later correct retry, so remediation can target it.

### 9.4 Real call sites

The module is on live paths, not parked next to them:

| Call site | What it now uses |
| --- | --- |
| `LessonView` flashcard bar | `masteryPercent` (fixes the 0.7% bar) |
| `learning-progress.ts` | `masteryPercent` behind `normalizeProgressPercent` |
| `NextForYou` | `conceptFromDueReview`, `masteryPercent` |
| `classroom-store.ts` | `transcriptLabelFor`, typed `evidence_type` |

The classroom transcript previously labelled every free-text submission
"Application", including explanation and recall prompts, misreporting the
learner's own record back to them.

### 9.5 Still Phase B, not yet done

Chat, Classroom and Test Prep now share a vocabulary but not yet a single
learner record: each still reads its own endpoint. Collapsing those onto one
client-side learner store needs the backend convergence in section 2.2, which
this workstream cannot write.

---

## 10. Phase C — iOS teaches through one classroom

iOS carried four classroom entry points. Only one was reachable.

| Path | Lines | Routed from | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Views/Main/Classroom/LivingClassroomView.swift` + `Services/LivingClassroomService.swift` | — | `MainTabView`, `EnhancedLyoHomeView`, `DiscoverView` | **CANONICAL** |
| `Services/LivingClassroomEngine.swift` | 589 | nothing | removed |
| `Services/LyoClassroomService.swift` | 143 | nothing | removed |
| `ViewModels/AgenticClassroomViewModel.swift` | 341 | only `AgenticClassroomView` | removed |
| `Views/Main/Classroom/AgenticClassroomView.swift` | 349 | only its own ViewModel | removed |

The Agentic pair referenced only each other — a mutually-referential island
that nothing outside could reach. 1,422 lines total.

Verified before removal, per the deprecation strategy in section 7: every type
each file declared (`LivingClassroomEngine`, `LyoClassroomService`,
`AgenticClassroomViewModel`, `AgenticClassroomView`, `AgentBlockCard`) has zero
references anywhere else in `Sources/` or `Tests/`, and the only non-Swift
references were the generated Xcode build entries. `ClassroomViewModel` is
**LEGACY_ACTIVE** and was deliberately kept: `MainTabView`,
`CourseOrchestrator`, both classroom overlays and `LiveClassroomSmokeTests` all
still use it.

### 10.1 Why the engine had to go, and what it was right about

`LivingClassroomEngine` was an on-device pedagogical loop, added because the
server-pushed classroom could dead-end — its own header says the screen "went
dead" when the backend stopped streaming scenes.

That failure is real and is not fixed by deleting the engine. But fixing it on
the client makes iOS a pedagogically different product from web and Android,
which is exactly what the parity gate exists to prevent. The correct fix is the
server-side safe fallback in section 29 of the specification: when scene
generation fails, teach something safe rather than dead-ending. That remains
open backend work.

### 10.2 Xcode project file

`project.yml` builds the target from the whole `Sources` tree, so
`Lyo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` is generated output and CI regenerates it with
`xcodegen generate`. It is also tracked, so the 16 generated entries for the
removed files were deleted from it by UUID to keep a local checkout openable
without regenerating first. No dangling UUID survives.

The six files added for Test Prep (§7.6) were **not** hand-added to it. Adding
a file means minting UUIDs across `PBXBuildFile`, `PBXFileReference`,
`PBXGroup` and two `PBXSourcesBuildPhase` entries, and this workstream has no
way to open the result and check it. CI regenerates the project before
building, so the build and the tests are unaffected; a local checkout needs
`xcodegen generate` once to see the new files in Xcode. Deleting entries by
UUID is verifiable by grep, which is why that direction was done by hand and
this one was not.

### 10.3 Verification limit

This workstream has no macOS toolchain, so the iOS target was **not compiled
here**. The removal rests on exhaustive symbol-reference checks rather than a
build. CI's `ios` job (`xcodegen generate` + `xcodebuild test`) is the
authoritative check.

## 9. Invariants the parity gate enforces

`scripts/verify-classroom-parity.mjs` is the CI guard that keeps Web, iOS and
Android from becoming pedagogically different products. It already pins shared
voice endpoint, locale flow, learner interruption, offline-safe skip, neutral
skip, hint requests, course identity and contract version.

`scripts/verify-product-trust.mjs` joins it as a second gate, pinning the
Phase A invariants: no fabricated learner stats on Home or the stats panel, a
front door whose CTAs reach real runtime paths, due reviews entering Classroom
review mode without a stored question, and one consumer brand.

Both gates assert against code with comments stripped, so a file may document
the fabricated block it replaced without tripping the gate that documentation
exists to explain.

The product-trust gate also pins the Phase B invariants: mastery requiring all
three strong forms, skipped questions staying neutral, the client never
declaring its own correctness, one mastery scale across renderers, and the
transcript naming the rung actually asked for.
