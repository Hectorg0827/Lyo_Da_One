// MARK: - Test Prep state
//
// The screen's transitions, kept in a plain struct that tests can drive.
//
// This shape is borrowed from `web/src/lib/test-prep-state.mjs`, and the
// borrowing is the point. That file exists because the same screen on web
// collected six rounds of review findings, four of them defects in the fix for
// the round before — every one a different combination of eighteen pieces of
// view state. Moving the decisions out of the view ended the streak. Writing
// this screen with `@State` scattered through a SwiftUI body would be
// volunteering for the same six rounds on a platform where nobody here can
// click through the result.
//
// The three rules those rounds produced, all of them learned the hard way:
//
//   - A failed request is never a fact about the learner. Not "no sessions
//     today", not "you have no plan".
//   - A refresh never destroys what is on screen.
//   - Finishing a session updates the list locally, so the row stops looking
//     open even if the refresh that would have removed it never lands.
