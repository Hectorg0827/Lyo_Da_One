/**
 * "What LYO recommends next" — the Home surface of the canonical learner
 * model.
 *
 * This block replaced a hard-coded "Daily Challenges" list whose progress
 * values ("1/2 lessons", "7/10 minutes") were invented constants shown to
 * every learner as their own activity, and which linked to a /challenges
 * route that does not exist.
 *
 * What it shows instead is real: what the learner's own record says they
 * should do next, from `api.personalization.recommendations()` — concepts
 * whose spaced-repetition schedule says they are due for retrieval, and
 * concepts they are weakest on. Each carries the reason it was chosen.
 *
 * The reason is not decoration. "You slipped on sign error last time" is a
 * different thing to be shown than an unexplained card, and it is the only
 * version a learner can disagree with, which is what makes it honest rather
 * than oracular. Both signals already existed; neither was reachable from
 * Home, and due reviews were reachable only from inside Chat.
 *
 * Tapping a review enters the Classroom in `review` mode rather than
 * replaying the old question, so retrieval is generated fresh and the
 * attempt produces retention evidence on the canonical learner record.
 *
 * See docs/CLASSROOM_ARCHITECTURE.md sections 5 and 6.
